Added a comprehensive field component library, client-side validation, and secret management integration. Updated all tool breadcrumbs to support the new configuration schema. Enhanced documentation with user guides and UI schema references. This major feature streamlines tool configuration, improves user experience, and eliminates hardcoded UI elements.
[33mcc12057[m Add OpenRouter LLM Tool (Self-Contained) JSON configuration: Introduced a new tool definition for the OpenRouter LLM Tool, including input and output schemas, execution logic, and example usage. This addition enables access to over 100 LLM models via a unified API, enhancing the toolset for developers and improving integration capabilities.
[33m257b5b9[m Implement self-contained tools system with Deno integration: Added support for self-contained tools using the new `tool.code.v1` format, enabling execution in a Deno runtime. Enhanced tool discovery and loading mechanisms to accommodate both legacy and new formats. Updated Docker configurations for Deno installation and improved logging for tool execution. Comprehensive documentation added for the new system.

Enhanced pricing formatting and model mapping functions for improved clarity and usability. The hook now fetches models directly from the OpenRouter API when necessary, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly experience.
[33m2cae3df[m Update .env
[33mcf2a27c[m Create LICENSE
[33mf322f2d[m Remove obsolete documentation files: Deleted multiple markdown files related to agent configuration, executor refactor, hot reload fixes, and tool definitions to streamline the repository and eliminate outdated content. This cleanup enhances maintainability and focuses on current implementation details.
[33m81f534d[m Refactor session management in Panel component: Enhanced session handling by implementing context breadcrumb updates for pausing and activating sessions. Improved session ID generation and ensured proper tagging during session creation and switching. Updated logging for better traceability of session actions, aligning with the RCRT approach.
[33m2902e01[m Refactor session handling in context builder: Implemented a hybrid approach to separate current session messages from semantically relevant messages across all sessions. Enhanced output structure for clarity, ensuring LLM prioritizes current conversations while maintaining semantic search functionality. Improved deduplication and logging for better traceability of message sources.
[33mcb44234[m Enhance agent response handling in AgentExecutorUniversal: Implemented session tag inheritance from triggers to maintain conversation isolation. Updated breadcrumb creation to include session IDs, ensuring responses are correctly associated with their respective sessions. Improved logging to reflect the tags used in responses for better traceability.
