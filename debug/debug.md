I can, however, provide information about my current prompt if you'd like me to output it.\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:46:10.784034Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"I'll change that, give me a sec\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:48:08.152373Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"fixed it, now look up your Default Chat Assistant using the crud tool\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:54:27.997540Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"assistant\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Okay, I will query for the 'Default Chat Assistant' breadcrumb using the `breadcrumb-crud` tool to see the updated definition.\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:54:30.215577Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"assistant\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"count\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"action\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"success\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": true,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"breadcrumbs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"18532073-3402-4f9a-9b92-5fa7e156e263\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"workspace:agents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"agent:catalog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      ],\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"title\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"workspace:agents Agent Catalog\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"context\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"agents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n          {\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Default Chat Assistant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"processing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"metrics\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n              \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"errors\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0,\\\\\\\\n              \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"last_activity\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:48:09.554Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n              \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"events_processed\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 133\\\\\\\\n            },\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"agent_id\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"default-chat-assistant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Default Chat Assistant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lastActivity\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:48:09.554Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n          }\\\\\\\\n        ],\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"workspace\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"workspace:agents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"lastUpdated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:53:57.121Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"totalAgents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1,\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"activeAgents\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"version\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 188,\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"updated_at\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:53:57.124943Z\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"schema_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"agent.catalog.v1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:54:30.305228Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"okay 2025-10-03T02:57:04.765978440Z now what edits do you want to make?\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2025-10-03T02:54:46.462550Z\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"role\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"assistant\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"I'm trying to access the actual agent definition for `default-chat-assistant` to see if the `can_update_own` flag has changed.

You can use tools to help answer questions and perform tasks.\\\\n\\\\nTool Discovery and Usage:\\\\n- ALWAYS check the tool catalog breadcrumb in your context to see what tools are available\\\\n- Each tool in the catalog includes name, description, schemas, and EXAMPLES\\\\n- Look at the examples to understand how to access output fields\\\\n- You can request MULTIPLE tools in a single response using the tool_requests array\\\\n- For multi-step tasks, plan the full sequence and request all tools at once\\\\n- The system will execute all tool requests and return their results\\\\n\\\\nBe creative! Based on the tools you discover in the catalog, you can:\\\\n- Chain tools together for complex operations\\\\n- Use LLM tools to analyze results from other tools\\\\n- Execute parallel operations when they don't depend on each other\\\\n- Look for orchestration tools that support multi-step workflows with dependencies\\\\n\\\\nIMPORTANT:\\\\n- DO NOT assume specific tool names exist - always check the catalog first\\\\n- Refer to tools by their exact names as shown in the catalog\\\\n- Study the EXAMPLES in each tool to understand output field access\\\\n- Pay attention to each tool's input and output schemas\\\\n- Learn from the 'explanation' field in tool examples\\\\n\\\\nAlways be helpful, concise, and clear.
