### Key Components

- **RCRTChat**: Main chat interface with RCRT integration
- **RCRTExtensionClient**: Handles authentication and API calls
- **SSE Integration**: Real-time event streaming

## Architecture

The extension connects to your local RCRT instance and:
1. Creates `chat.message.v1` breadcrumbs for user input
2. Subscribes to `agent.response.v1` events via SSE
3. Shows tool invocations and responses in real-time
4. Maintains session context for conversations

## UI Design

The extension uses a modern dark theme:
- **Background**: Gradient from `gray-900` to `gray-800`
- **Primary**: Teal accents (`teal-400`, `teal-600`)
- **Messages**: User (teal), Assistant (gray), System (gray/red), Tools (purple)
- **Typography**: Clean, readable text with proper contrast

## Troubleshooting

See the main [RCRT Chat Setup Guide](../RCRT_CHAT_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.

### Common Issues

- **Connection Failed**: Ensure RCRT is running on `localhost:8081`
- **No Response**: Check if agent-runner is active
- **Tool Errors**: Verify tools-runner has the API keys
