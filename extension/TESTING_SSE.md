# Testing RCRT Real-Time Integration

## ✅ What's Now Implemented

### 🚀 **Real SSE Integration**
- **Event Stream**: Extension connects to `localhost:8082/api/events/stream`
- **Request Tracking**: Matches tool responses to original requests
- **Real-time Updates**: Actual OpenRouter responses flow back to extension
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout if no response

### 🔄 **Complete Flow**
```
Extension Chat → OpenRouter Tool Request → Tools Runner → OpenRouter API → Tool Response → Extension UI
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. **Reload Extension** (Essential)
```bash
# chrome://extensions/ → reload ThinkOS Agent extension
```

### 2. **Check Console Messages**
**Background Console** should show:
```
🚀 RCRT Extension: READY
📡 Connecting to RCRT event stream: http://localhost:8082/api/events/stream
✅ Connected to RCRT event stream
📡 RCRT Event Stream: CONNECTED
```

### 3. **Test Real Chat**
1. **Open sidepanel** → Click extension icon
2. **Send message** → Type "Hello" and send
3. **Watch console** → Should see:
```
📨 Tool response received: {request_id: "abc123...", content: "Hello! How...", metadata: {...}}
```
4. **Check UI** → Should show **actual OpenRouter response** instead of placeholder!

### 4. **Verify in Dashboard**
- Visit `http://localhost:8082`
- **Right panel** → Should see both request and response events
- **Response content** should match what appears in extension

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ **Working Real-time Chat**
- Extension sends message → Creates breadcrumb
- Tools-runner processes → Calls OpenRouter API  
- Response flows back → Updates extension UI
- **Real LLM conversation** in extension! 🤖

### ✅ **Console Messages**
```
📡 RCRT Event received: {type: "breadcrumb.updated", schema_name: "tool.response.v1"}
📨 Tool response received: {request_id: "...", content: "Hello! How can I help you today?"}
✅ Matching response found for request: abc123...
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Event Stream Connection
- Check dashboard is running on 8082
- Verify CSP allows localhost:8082 connections
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### No Responses in Extension
- Verify tools-runner is running (`npm start`)
- Check OpenRouter API key is configured in RCRT secrets
- Look for errors in tools-runner console

### Timeout Issues
- OpenRouter requests take 1-3 seconds normally
- Check tools-runner logs for API failures
- Verify workspace tags match (`workspace:tools`)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The extension should now:
1. **✅ Connect to RCRT** via dashboard proxy
2. **✅ Send real OpenRouter requests** (not placeholder chat_agent)
3. **✅ Receive real LLM responses** via SSE events
4. **✅ Update UI in real-time** with actual chat responses
5. **✅ Work exactly like dashboard** but in Chrome sidepanel

**Ready to test real RCRT chat integration!** 🚀
