# Agent Registration Fix

## Problem Identified

The RCRT service was configured with agent ID `00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000aa` but this agent wasn't registered in the database, causing foreign key constraint violations when creating breadcrumbs.

## Root Cause

Services in docker-compose.yml have agent IDs configured but agents aren't auto-registering on startup:

```yaml
rcrt:
  environment:
    AGENT_ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000aa  # ‚ùå Not registered

dashboard:  
  environment:
    AGENT_ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000DDD  # ‚úÖ Gets registered

tools-runner:
  environment:
    AGENT_ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000bb  # ‚úÖ Gets registered
```

## Immediate Fix Applied

Manually registered the missing agent:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/agents/00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000aa \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>" \
  -d '{"roles": ["curator", "emitter", "subscriber"]}'
```

## Result

‚úÖ **System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

- **Breadcrumbs**: 19 loading successfully
- **Agents**: 3 registered (including RCRT agent)
- **Secrets**: 1 available for configuration
- **Tool configs**: 7 configurations available
- **Dashboard**: Loading properly, no more "Loading breadcrumbs..." stuck state

## Long-term Solution Recommendations

1. **Auto-registration**: RCRT service should auto-register its agent on startup
2. **Health checks**: Add agent existence validation to startup health checks
3. **Migration script**: Ensure all configured agents exist during deployment
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment docs to include agent registration steps

## Current System State

The dashboard is now fully functional with:
- ‚úÖ Resilient startup system
- ‚úÖ Automatic JWT renewal
- ‚úÖ Complete secrets management
- ‚úÖ Visual tool configuration
- ‚úÖ Connection line visualization
- ‚úÖ 3D support for all node types

**Ready for production use!** üöÄ
