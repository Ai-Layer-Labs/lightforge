# RCRT Pure Native Implementation

## üö´ All Fallbacks Removed

We have successfully purged ALL non-conformant code from the system. The RCRT tool system is now 100% breadcrumb-native with NO fallbacks to legacy approaches.

## What Was Removed

### 1. **Registry-Based System** ‚ùå DELETED
- `registry.ts` - Completely removed
- In-memory tool storage - Gone
- Tool wrappers - Eliminated
- `createToolRegistry` - No longer exists

### 2. **RCRTToolWrapper** ‚ùå DELETED  
- No more "starting" tools
- No more wrapper instances
- Tools are just discovered from breadcrumbs

### 3. **LangChain Integration** ‚ùå DELETED
- `langchain.ts` - Removed
- No more wrapper-based tools
- No more in-memory registration

### 4. **Legacy Configuration** ‚ùå DELETED
- `enableBuiltins` - Gone
- `enableLangChain` - Gone  
- `enableLLMTools` - Gone
- `useNativeToolLoader` - Gone (it's the ONLY way now)

## The New Pure System

### Tool Discovery Flow
```
1. Bootstrap creates tool.v1 breadcrumbs
2. Tools are discovered via breadcrumb search
3. ToolLoader resolves implementations
4. No memory, no registry, no wrappers
```

### Key Components

1. **`bootstrap-tools.ts`** - Creates tool breadcrumbs on startup
2. **`tool-loader.ts`** - Loads tools from breadcrumbs ONLY
3. **`tools-runner`** - Uses pure breadcrumb discovery

### How It Works

```javascript
// On startup
await bootstrapTools(client, workspace);

// To execute a tool
const loader = new ToolLoader(client, workspace);
const tool = await loader.loadToolByName('random');
const result = await tool.execute(input, context);
```

## Benefits

1. **No Confusion** - One way to do things
2. **No Legacy Code** - Clean, modern implementation
3. **Pure RCRT** - Everything is a breadcrumb
4. **No Fallbacks** - No chance of using old patterns
5. **Future Proof** - Built the right way from the start

## Migration Complete

The system is now fully RCRT-native. There is no legacy code, no fallbacks, and no compromises. Tools are breadcrumbs, discovery is dynamic, and the system is truly distributed.
