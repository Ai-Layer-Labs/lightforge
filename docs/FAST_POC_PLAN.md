# RCRT Vibe Coding POC - Fast Track Plan

**Goal**: Working vibe coding demo in 3-4 weeks using VS Code Web + Roocode  
**Strategy**: Fork proven open-source bases, integrate RCRT context  
**Timeline**: Sprint to POC, then decide on full build  

---

## Why This Can Be Fast

### Leverage Existing Code Bases

#### 1. VS Code Web (Microsoft Open Source)
**What it provides**:
- ✅ Full Monaco editor
- ✅ File tree and explorer
- ✅ Syntax highlighting
- ✅ Multi-file editing
- ✅ Search and replace
- ✅ Extensions API
- ✅ Git integration
- ✅ Terminal (xterm.js)

**What we add**: RCRT context panel (sidebar)

**Effort**: 1 week to fork and customize

#### 2. Roocode (AI Coding IDE Base)
**What it provides**:
- ✅ AI chat interface
- ✅ Inline code generation
- ✅ Diff view (accept/reject)
- ✅ Multi-file generation
- ✅ Project templates

**What we replace**: Their context system with RCRT's superior one

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks to integrate RCRT backend

### RCRT Integration Points
**Already built**:
- ✅ REST API for breadcrumbs
- ✅ SSE for real-time updates
- ✅ Context-builder tool (just need to call it)
- ✅ Agent system (already generates code suggestions)

**Just need**: Wire up VS Code Web UI to existing RCRT APIs

### Key Insight
**80% of the work is already done** (RCRT backend). We're just adding a frontend UI layer.

---

## LLM Flexibility (RCRT's Secret Weapon)

### Supported LLM Options

#### 1. Cloud Models (via OpenRouter)
```typescript
{
  tool: "openrouter",
  models: [
    "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    "openai/gpt-4o",
    "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b",
    // 100+ more models
  ]
}
```
**Use case**: Maximum model choice, pay-per-use

#### 2. Local Models (via Ollama)
```typescript
{
  tool: "ollama_local",
  models: [
    "llama3.1",
    "codellama",
    "qwen2.5-coder",
    "deepseek-coder-v2"
  ],
  endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
}
```
**Use case**: Free, private, no internet required

#### 3. Enterprise Secure Gateway (Azure OpenAI)
```typescript
{
  tool: "azure-openai", // Easy to add
  endpoint: "https://your-company.openai.azure.com",
  deployment: "gpt-4o-prod",
  api_key: "{from RCRT secrets}"
}
```
**Use case**: Compliance requirements, data residency, enterprise SLA

#### 4. On-Prem Custom Models
```typescript
{
  tool: "custom-llm",
  endpoint: "https://internal-llm-gateway.company.local",
  auth: "bearer_token_from_secrets",
  model: "company-finetuned-model-v3"
}
```
**Use case**: Air-gapped environments, proprietary models, maximum security

### Why This Matters for Enterprise

**Flexibility = Sales Wins**:
- Finance company: "We need on-prem only" → ✅ Use Ollama locally
- Healthcare: "HIPAA requires Azure" → ✅ Use Azure OpenAI gateway
- Government: "Air-gapped network" → ✅ Use local models
- Startup: "Cheapest option" → ✅ Use Ollama (free) or OpenRouter (cheap)

**Competitors**: Locked to single provider
- Copilot: Only GitHub models
- Cursor: Only Anthropic/OpenAI
- Replit: Only their hosted models

**RCRT**: Works with anything. This is a HUGE competitive advantage.

## Faster POC Plan Using VS Code Web + Roocode

### Revised Timeline: 2-3 Weeks (Not 10-12!)

### Week 1: Rapid Integration
**Day 1**: 
- Fork VS Code Web (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
- Clone Roocode (https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) for AI UI patterns
- Review both codebases

**Day 2-3**:
- Strip out Roocode's backend (we have RCRT)
- Extract AI UI components (chat panel, diff view, inline suggestions)
- Integrate into VS Code Web sidebar

**Day 4-5**:
- Connect to RCRT REST API
  - `/breadcrumbs` for context
  - `/agents` for agent status
  - `/events/stream` for real-time updates
- Wire up authentication (JWT)

**Deliverable**: VS Code Web with RCRT context sidebar + AI chat

### Week 2: Code Generation Flow
**Day 1-2**:
- User types in chat → creates user.message.v1 breadcrumb
- Context-builder assembles context (already works!)
- Agent generates response (already works!)
- Display response in chat panel

**Day 3-4**:
- Agent response includes code → display in diff view (Roocode component)
- Accept button → apply to file
- Reject button → discard
- Test: Generate simple function ✅

**Day 5**:
- Multi-file generation
- Agent creates 3 files → show all in tabs
- Accept all or individually

**Deliverable**: End-to-end code generation working

### Week 3: Polish for Demo
**Day 1-2**:
- File tree operations (create, rename, delete)
- Inline suggestions (comment → code)
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Day 3**:
- Error handling (network issues, API errors)
- Loading states
- Success animations

**Day 4-5**:
- Record demo video
- Create pitch deck
- Beta test with 2-3 real users
- Fix showstoppers

**Deliverable**: Demo-ready POC

**Cost**: $15K-20K (3 weeks contractor rate)  
**Infrastructure**: $0 (use existing RCRT backend)  
**Total**: ~$20K

**Risk**: Very low (mostly configuration, not building from scratch)  
**Return**: Demote-able product for customer validation

### POC to Production (Additional 6-8 weeks)
**Team**: 1 frontend + 1 backend engineer  
**Cost**: $60K-80K  
**Features**: Polish, error handling, onboarding, deployment support  
**Total**: $80K-100K for production-ready MVP

**Compare to original estimate**: $500K+ → Now $100K (5x cheaper!)

## LLM Strategy: Why "Any Model" is Critical

### Enterprise Deployment Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Financial Services Startup
**Requirements**: Fast, cheap, good enough
**RCRT Configuration**:
```yaml
Primary LLM: google/gemini-2.5-flash (via OpenRouter)
- Cost: $0.009 per 1M tokens
- Speed: Fast
- Quality: Good for 80% of tasks

Fallback LLM: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 (for complex tasks)
- Cost: $0.03 per 1M tokens
- Use when: Gemini fails or complex refactoring
```
**Result**: $200/month LLM costs for 10 developers

#### Scenario 2: Healthcare Enterprise
**Requirements**: HIPAA compliance, zero data leakage
**RCRT Configuration**:
```yaml
Primary LLM: Azure OpenAI (in their tenant)
- Endpoint: https://healthco.openai.azure.com
- Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
- Data: Stays in Azure (compliance ✅)

Fallback LLM: Local Ollama (air-gapped network)
- Model: codellama
- Offline: Works without internet
```
**Result**: Full HIPAA compliance, auditable

#### Scenario 3: Government/Defense
**Requirements**: Air-gapped, on-premise only
**RCRT Configuration**:
```yaml
Primary LLM: Local LLaMA (fine-tuned on internal code)
- Deployed: On-prem GPU cluster
- Model: llama-3.1-70b-company-finetuned
- Internet: Not required

Context: RCRT deployed on-prem
- Database: Internal PostgreSQL
- NATS: Internal message bus
- No external calls ever
```
**Result**: Maximum security, full control

### Tool Configuration (Already Supported!)

**Current tools**:
- `openrouter` - 100+ cloud models
- `ollama_local` - Local models

**Easy to add** (1-2 days each):
- `azure-openai` - Enterprise secure gateway
- `aws-bedrock` - AWS-hosted models
- `google-vertex` - Google Cloud AI
- `custom-endpoint` - Any HTTP endpoint

**All configured via dashboard UI** - no code changes required!

## Roocode Integration: What We Can Borrow

### Roocode's AI UI Components (Open Source)

1. **Chat Panel**
   - Clean message history
   - Code formatting
   - Copy button
   - Regenerate button

2. **Diff View**
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Accept/reject buttons
   - Line-by-line review
   - Syntax highlighting in diffs

3. **Inline Suggestions**
   - Ghost text rendering
   - Tab to accept
   - Escape to dismiss
   - Multiple suggestions

4. **Multi-File Generation**
   - Tree view of files to create
   - Preview each file
   - Select which to apply
   - Batch operations

### What We Replace in Roocode

**Their backend** (simple, not enterprise-ready):
```
Roocode: Direct OpenAI calls → No context management
```

**Our backend** (enterprise-grade):
```
RCRT: Context-builder → pgvector semantic search → Agent system
```

**Result**: Roocode's UI polish + RCRT's context power

## Cost Comparison: Fast Track vs. Build from Scratch

### Original Estimate (Build Everything)
- Timeline: 10-12 weeks
- Team: 2 frontend engineers
- Cost: $120K
- Risk: High (unproven approach)

### Fast Track (Fork VS Code + Roocode)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks for POC
- Team: 1 frontend engineer
- Cost: $20K
- Risk: Low (proven codebases)

### Savings
- **6x faster**: 2-3 weeks vs. 12 weeks
- **6x cheaper**: $20K vs. $120K
- **Lower risk**: Fork working code vs. build from zero

**Why?** We're integrating, not inventing. VS Code Web + Roocode already solve 80% of UI problems.

## Demo Script (What POC Will Show)

### Scenario: Non-Technical PM Creates Feature

**Step 1: Open Project**
```
User: Opens VS Code Web with React project
UI: Shows file tree, editor, RCRT context panel
```

**Step 2: Ask Question**
```
User: Types in chat "Add a login button to the navbar"
RCRT: Context-builder finds relevant code (Navbar.tsx, Button components, auth flow)
Agent: Receives 400K tokens of relevant context
```

**Step 3: AI Generates Code**
```
Agent: Generates updated Navbar.tsx with login button
UI: Shows diff view (green additions, red deletions)
User: Clicks "Accept"
UI: Code applied to file
```

**Step 4: Multi-File Generation**
```
User: "Also add a login modal component"
Agent: Creates LoginModal.tsx + LoginModal.test.tsx
UI: Shows both files in separate tabs
User: Reviews both, accepts both
```

**Step 5: Inline Suggestion**
```
User: Types comment in code "// add loading state"
Agent: Generates code suggestion inline (ghost text)
User: Presses Tab
UI: Code inserted
```

**Time**: Entire flow in <2 minutes  
**Audience Reaction**: "Holy shit, this actually works"

## Competitive Positioning with Multi-LLM

### Pitch to Different Enterprises

#### Pitch 1: "We Work with YOUR Infrastructure"
```
Enterprise CTO: "We already have Azure OpenAI enterprise agreement"
Us: "Perfect! RCRT works with Azure OpenAI. Just configure the endpoint."
CTO: "What about on-prem for sensitive code?"
Us: "Deploy RCRT on-prem with local LLaMA models. No internet required."
CTO: "Sold."
```

#### Pitch 2: "Start Free, Scale to Paid"
```
Startup CTO: "We can't afford enterprise pricing"
Us: "Start with free Ollama models locally. Zero LLM costs."
CTO: "When we grow?"
Us: "Switch to OpenRouter. Pay only for what you use. $50-200/month typically."
CTO: "Show me the demo"
```

#### Pitch 3: "Maximum Security"
```
Security Officer: "We can't send code to external APIs"
Us: "Deploy RCRT on-premise. Use your own models. Air-gapped."
Officer: "What about audit logs?"
Us: "Built-in. Every breadcrumb access logged. Export to your SIEM."
Officer: "Schedule a security review"
```

### Why Competitors Can't Match This

**GitHub Copilot**: Locked to GitHub's models (Microsoft's business model)  
**Cursor**: Locked to Anthropic/OpenAI (partnership agreements)  
**Replit**: Locked to their hosted models (walled garden)

**RCRT**: Model-agnostic by design. **This is a strategic advantage.**

## Why This Changes Everything

### Old Plan
- Build IDE from scratch: 12 weeks, $120K, high risk
- Locked to one LLM provider
- Unclear if anyone wants it

### New Plan
- Fork VS Code + Roocode: **3 weeks, $20K, low risk**
- **Works with ANY LLM** (cloud, local, on-prem)
- Validate first, then build

### Strategic Impact
1. **Faster to market**: 6x speed increase
2. **Cheaper**: 6x cost reduction  
3. **Lower risk**: Proven codebases, not greenfield
4. **Bigger TAM**: Any enterprise, any compliance requirement, any LLM preference

**This makes RCRT viable as a business.**

---

## Bottom Line

**What changed**:
- ✅ Recognized we can fork VS Code Web (don't build from scratch)
- ✅ Found Roocode as AI UI component source
- ✅ Realized 80% is already built (RCRT backend)
- ✅ Emphasized multi-LLM support (strategic differentiator)

**New reality**:
- **POC in 3 weeks, not 12** ($20K, not $120K)
- **Works with any LLM** (local, cloud, on-prem, secure gateway)
- **Lower risk, faster validation**

**Recommendation**:
1. Finish validation experiments (2 more weeks)
2. If positive → Greenlight 3-week POC sprint
3. Demo to potential customers
4. If they buy → Build to production (8 weeks)
5. If they don't → Pivot or stop

**Total time to know if we have a business**: 5 weeks, $30K total investment.

---

**Updated**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Fast track plan ready, awaiting validation results  
**Next Milestone**: Validation results (2 weeks)  
**Decision Point**: Week 3 - Go/No-Go on POC sprint
