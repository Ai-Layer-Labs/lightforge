# Smart Interpolation - Auto-Correction During Execution

## What It Does

The workflow tool now **automatically corrects wrong field access** during variable interpolation, so workflows "just work" even when agents use incorrect syntax!

## How It Works

### Before (Strict)
```javascript
Agent: "${stepId.output.value}"
Data: { numbers: [42] }
Result: undefined → Error ❌
```

### After (Smart)
```javascript
Agent: "${stepId.output.value}"
Data: { numbers: [42] }

Workflow: "Field 'output.value' doesn't exist, trying smart mapping..."
Workflow: "Data has 'numbers' field → Use that instead"
Workflow: "Auto-corrected to ${stepId.numbers[0]} = 42"

Result: 42 → Success ✅
```

## Supported Auto-Corrections

### Pattern 1: `.output` or `.output.value`
```javascript
"${stepId.output}"         → Auto-maps to actual first field
"${stepId.output.value}"   → Auto-maps to actual first field

// Maps to:
{ numbers: [...] }  → stepId.numbers[0]
{ result: 42 }      → stepId.result
{ echo: "text" }    → stepId.echo
```

### Pattern 2: `.result` or `.result.number`
```javascript
"${stepId.result}"         → Checks if .result exists, else maps
"${stepId.result.number}"  → Auto-maps to numbers array

// Maps to:
{ result: 42 }      → stepId.result (correct!)
{ numbers: [...] }  → stepId.numbers[0]
```

### Pattern 3: Generic Smart Mapping
```javascript
// Any wrong field path
"${stepId.wrong.field.path}"

// Workflow checks:
1. Does 'wrong' exist? No
2. What fields ARE available? [numbers, status]
3. Pick first number/array field
4. Auto-map and log correction
```

## Execution Flow

```
1. Agent: "${generate_random_1.output.value}"

2. Workflow: Try to access stepId.output.value
   → result.output is undefined

3. Workflow: Smart mapping activated
   → Actual data: { numbers: [74] }
   → Pattern match: .output.value
   → Has 'numbers' field? YES
   → Use numbers[0]

4. Workflow: Log correction
   "[Workflow] ✅ Auto-corrected generate_random_1.output.value → generate_random_1.numbers[0] = 74"

5. Calculator: Receives "74 + 87"
   → Evaluates successfully
   → Returns { result: 161 }

6. ✅ Workflow succeeds!

7. System Feedback: Still created for agent to learn
   "You used .output.value but the correct field is .numbers[0]"
```

## Combined with System Feedback

### First Execution (Auto-Corrects)
```
Agent: Uses wrong syntax
Workflow: Auto-corrects → Succeeds ✅
System: Creates feedback anyway → "Here's the correct syntax"
Agent: Learns for next time
```

### Second Execution (Learned)
```
Agent: Uses correct syntax (learned from feedback)
Workflow: No correction needed
System: No feedback (success)
```

## Benefits

1. **Forgiving** - Workflows succeed even with wrong syntax
2. **Educational** - Agent still learns the right way
3. **Fast** - No retry loop needed
4. **Generic** - Works for any tool output structure
5. **Logged** - All corrections visible in logs

## What Gets Auto-Corrected

✅ `.output` → Actual field  
✅ `.output.value` → Actual field  
✅ `.result` → .numbers[0] (if no .result)  
✅ `.result.number` → .numbers[0]  
✅ `.value` → Actual value field  

## What Doesn't Get Auto-Corrected

❌ Completely wrong step IDs  
❌ Non-existent fields with no pattern  
❌ Type mismatches (string → number)  
❌ Complex nested structures

For these, the system feedback provides guidance!

## Example Logs

```
[Workflow] Auto-converted variable syntax: "{{step1.output}}" → "${step1.output}"
[Workflow] Field "output" not found in step1, attempting smart mapping...
[Workflow] Actual data structure: { numbers: [ 42 ] }
[Workflow] ✅ Auto-corrected step1.output → step1.numbers[0] = 42
[Workflow] Step calculator: Calling calculator with { expression: '42 + 87' }
[Workflow] ✅ Received event for workflow-calculator-...
[Workflow] Step calculator completed: { result: 129 }
✅ Workflow succeeded in 95ms!
```

## This Makes the Workflow Tool "Just Work"! 🎉

Combined with:
- ✅ Auto-dependency detection
- ✅ Syntax auto-conversion ({{}} → ${})
- ✅ Smart field mapping
- ✅ System feedback for learning

**The workflow tool is now incredibly robust and forgiving!**
