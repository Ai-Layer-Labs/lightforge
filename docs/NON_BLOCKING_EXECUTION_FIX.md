# Non-Blocking Tool Execution - The Fix

## The Problem (From Your Logs)

SSE stream was BLOCKING on tool execution:

```javascript
// SSE event handler (OLD - BLOCKING)
for (const event of sseStream) {
  await dispatchEventToTool(event);  // ← BLOCKS HERE!
  // Can't process next event until tool finishes
}
```

**Timeline:**
```
17:35:52.506 - Workflow starts executing (blocks SSE thread)
17:35:52.506 - Workflow creates 3 tool.request breadcrumbs
17:35:52.529 - Workflow waits for responses
             - SSE thread is BLOCKED in workflow.execute()
             - New events queue up but can't be delivered
17:36:52.527 - Timeout (60 seconds)
17:36:52.551 - Workflow returns, SSE thread unblocked
17:36:52.551 - Queued events finally delivered ← TOO LATE!
```

## The Fix

```javascript
// SSE event handler (NEW - NON-BLOCKING)
for (const event of sseStream) {
  // Feed to EventBridge first
  if (event.type === 'breadcrumb.updated') {
    const breadcrumb = await client.getBreadcrumb(event.breadcrumb_id);
    globalEventBridge.handleEvent(event, breadcrumb);
  }
  
  // Execute tool asynchronously (don't await!)
  dispatchEventToTool(event, client, workspace)
    .catch(error => console.error('Tool error:', error));
  
  // Continue to next event immediately
}
```

## Why This Works

### Before (Blocking)
```
SSE: Event 1 → Execute Tool A → [BLOCKED 60s] → Done
                                      ↓
                        Events 2,3,4 QUEUED but not processed
                                      ↓
                              After 60s, deliver events
```

### After (Non-Blocking)
```
SSE: Event 1 → Start Tool A execution (background)
     Event 2 → Start Tool B execution (background) ← Immediate!
     Event 3 → Start Tool C execution (background) ← Immediate!
     Event 4 → Start Tool D execution (background) ← Immediate!
     
All tools run in parallel, SSE stream never blocks!
```

## Expected Timeline After Fix

```
17:35:52.506 - Workflow starts (doesn't block SSE)
17:35:52.507 - Workflow creates tool.request #1
17:35:52.507 - SSE delivers tool.request #1 ← INSTANT!
17:35:52.508 - Random tool executes
17:35:52.508 - tool.response #1 created
17:35:52.509 - EventBridge delivers to workflow ← INSTANT!
17:35:52.510 - Workflow creates tool.request #2
17:35:52.511 - SSE delivers tool.request #2 ← INSTANT!
... etc ...
17:35:52.600 - ✅ Workflow complete in ~100ms!
```

## RCRT-Native? YES!

This is the correct RCRT way because:
1. ✅ Everything is still breadcrumbs
2. ✅ Events drive everything
3. ✅ Fully asynchronous
4. ✅ Non-blocking (true event-driven)
5. ✅ Scales to infinite nesting

## The Code Change

One line changed:
```javascript
// Before:
await dispatchEventToTool(eventData, client, workspace);

// After:
dispatchEventToTool(eventData, client, workspace)
  .catch(error => console.error('Tool error:', error));
```

**Simple but critical!**

## Benefits

- 🚀 **Fast**: Events process immediately
- 📊 **Scalable**: Unlimited parallel tool execution
- 🔄 **Non-blocking**: SSE stream never stalls
- ✅ **RCRT-Native**: Pure event-driven architecture
- 🎯 **Works for any pattern**: Workflows, agents, nested tools

## Next Step

Rebuild Docker:
```bash
docker compose build tools-runner
docker compose up -d tools-runner
```

Expected result:
- Workflow completes in <1 second
- All 3 tools execute in parallel
- No timeouts!
