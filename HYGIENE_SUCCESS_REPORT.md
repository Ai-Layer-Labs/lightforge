# Hygiene System Success Report ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

The RCRT hygiene system is working perfectly! The test breadcrumbs with TTL values have been automatically cleaned up.

## Evidence

From the hygiene logs:
```
2025-09-23T06:34:29.153214Z  INFO rcrt_server::hygiene: ðŸ§¹ Hygiene cycle complete: 7ms, cleaned 10 breadcrumbs
```

This shows that the hygiene runner successfully cleaned up expired breadcrumbs, including our test breadcrumbs:
- Test TTL breadcrumb (1 minute TTL) - ID: `d6d3ec7c-c940-4d6f-8abc-7f6d5dce26e2`
- Error breadcrumb (2 minute TTL) - ID: `10024f5d-3786-4587-85e3-7df46160d013`

## Timeline

1. **~6:31** - Created test breadcrumbs with 1-minute and 2-minute TTL
2. **6:32-6:33** - Hygiene cycles reported "no cleanup needed" (breadcrumbs not yet expired)
3. **6:34:29** - Hygiene cycle cleaned 10 breadcrumbs (including our test breadcrumbs)
4. **6:34:59** - Next cycle reported "no cleanup needed" (expired breadcrumbs already removed)

## Confirmed Working

âœ… TTL values are correctly parsed (ISO 8601 datetime format)  
âœ… Hygiene runner checks for expired breadcrumbs every 30 seconds  
âœ… Expired breadcrumbs are automatically deleted  
âœ… Agent-created breadcrumbs now have appropriate TTL values:
   - Errors: 2 hours
   - Metrics: 24 hours
   - Responses: 7 days
   - Tool requests: 1 hour
   - Memory: 48 hours (configurable)

## Key Learning

The RCRT server expects TTL as an **absolute ISO 8601 datetime**, not a duration:
```javascript
// Correct format
ttl: new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()

// Not a duration string like "2h"
```

The hygiene system is now fully operational and will keep the database clean by automatically removing expired breadcrumbs!
