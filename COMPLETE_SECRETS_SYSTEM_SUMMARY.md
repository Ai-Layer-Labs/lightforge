## 🎨 **Visual Elements Now Available**

### Canvas Nodes
- **🔐 Secret Nodes**: Red/orange rectangular nodes (120x80px)
  - Smart icons based on secret name (🔑 for API keys, 🧠 for OpenRouter, etc.)
  - Scope indicators (🌐 global, 🏢 workspace, 🤖 agent)
  - Draggable and clickable

### Connection Lines
- **🔗 Secret → Tool**: Red/orange gradient lines showing which tools use which secrets
- **🔗 Secret → Agent**: Lines showing agent-scoped secret access
- **Hover Tooltips**: Show relationship details

### 3D Visualization
- **3D Secret Cards**: Rendered with proper styling and icons
- **3D Interactions**: Click and hover support
- **Semantic Positioning**: Secrets clustered by scope and usage

## 🛠️ **User Workflow (Exactly What You Wanted)**

### 1. **Configure OpenRouter Tool**
```
1. Navigate to dashboard: http://localhost:8082
2. Look for OpenRouter tool node (🧠) on the canvas
3. Click the OpenRouter tool node
4. Tool details appear in left panel
5. Click "Configure" button
6. Select "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" from secret dropdown
7. Click "Save Config"
8. Visual connection line appears: Secret → Tool
```

### 2. **Manage Secrets**
```
1. Use "🔐 Secrets" section in left panel
2. Create new secrets with name, scope, and value
3. View/edit/delete existing secrets
4. See all secrets as nodes on canvas
5. Drag secrets to organize visually
```

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
```
- Secret nodes appear on left side of canvas
- Connection lines show secret → tool relationships
- Tool nodes show configuration status
- 3D view includes all secrets with proper clustering
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### Backend API Endpoints
```
GET    /api/secrets              - List all secrets
POST   /api/secrets              - Create new secret
PUT    /api/secrets/:id          - Update secret value
DELETE /api/secrets/:id          - Delete secret
POST   /api/secrets/:id/decrypt  - Decrypt secret (audited)
```

### Frontend Modules
```
secrets-manager.js    - Handles all secrets operations
node-renderer.js      - Renders secret nodes on canvas
canvas-engine.js      - Manages secret node interactions
3d-engine.js          - 3D visualization for secrets
dashboard-controller.js - Orchestrates secrets integration
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Dashboard loads secrets from API
2. Creates visual nodes on canvas
3. Detects tool configurations in breadcrumbs
4. Renders connection lines
5. Updates UI panels with secret lists
6. Enables tool configuration workflow
```

## 🎯 **Current System State**

**Secrets Available:**
- ✅ OPENROUTER_API_KEY (global scope)
- ✅ SERPAPI_API_KEY (global scope)  
- ✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (workspace scope)
- ✅ TEST_SECRET (global scope)

**Tool Configurations:**
- ✅ 7 tool configuration breadcrumbs detected
- ✅ Ready for OpenRouter configuration

**Visual Elements:**

- ✅ Connection line system active
- ✅ 3D support implemented
- ✅ Interactive UI panels

## 📱 **How to Use Right Now**

1. **Open Dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8082`

2. **View Secrets**: 
   - See red/orange secret nodes on the left side of canvas
   - Check "🔐 Secrets" section in left panel

3. **Configure OpenRouter**:
   - Find the OpenRouter tool node (🧠) on the canvas
   - Click it to open tool details in left panel
   - Click "Configure" to map the OPENROUTER_API_KEY secret

4. **Create New Secrets**:
   - Use the form in the "🔐 Secrets" section
   - Fill in name, scope, and value
   - Click "Create Secret"

5. **View Connections**:
   - Red/orange lines show secret → tool relationships
   - Hover over lines for relationship details

6. **3D View**:
   - Click "🎲 3D View" button
   - See secrets in 3D space with semantic clustering

## 🚀 **Benefits Achieved**

1. **✅ Visual Secret Management**: All secrets visible as nodes on canvas
2. **✅ Tool Configuration**: Easy OpenRouter setup with secret mapping  
3. **✅ Relationship Visualization**: Clear connections between secrets and tools
4. **✅ Secure Operations**: Encrypted storage with audit trails
5. **✅ 3D Support**: Secrets included in 3D visualization
6. **✅ Complete CRUD**: Full lifecycle management for secrets
