# Complete Implementation Summary & Deploy Guide

## 🎯 What Was Implemented Today

### 1. RCRT-Native Tool System
- ✅ Tools as breadcrumbs (tool.v1)
- ✅ ToolLoader for dynamic discovery
- ✅ Bootstrap script creates tool breadcrumbs
- ✅ Removed all in-memory registry code
- ✅ OpenRouter models catalog
- ✅ Tool examples with field access patterns

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- ✅ EventBridge for instant event correlation
- ✅ Non-blocking tool execution (SSE doesn't block)
- ✅ context.waitForEvent() API for tools

### 3. Workflow Tool Enhancements
- ✅ Auto-dependency detection (scans for ${stepId})
- ✅ Variable syntax auto-conversion ({{}} → ${})
- ✅ System feedback on errors (system.message.v1)
- ✅ Intelligent field access correction

### 4. Self-Teaching System
- ✅ Workflow creates system.message.v1 on errors
- ✅ Agent subscribes to system.message.v1
- ✅ Agent acknowledges learning
- ✅ System provides corrected examples

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deploy, you should see these logs:

### EventBridge Working
```
[EventBridge] Initialized
[EventBridge] Added to pending waits (X total)
[EventBridge] ✅ Event matches waiting request
```

### Auto-Dependency Detection
```
[Workflow] Auto-detected dependencies for step: [step1, step2]
[Workflow] Dependencies resolved: [...]
```

### System Feedback
```
[Workflow] Auto-correcting: ${stepId.result} for stepId=..., data=...
[Workflow] 📚 Created system feedback for agent learning
```

### Agent Learning
```
💡 System Guidance:
  Available data: { numbers: [42] }
  Suggested fix: "${stepId.numbers[0]}"
  
Agent response: "I received guidance about workflow errors..."
```

## 🚨 Current Issue

The agent is RECEIVING the feedback (✅ Working!) but:

1. **Agent uses `"tool_name"`** instead of `"tool"` → Workflow schema violation
2. **Agent uses `.result`** instead of `.numbers[0]` → Field access error
3. **System feedback isn't specific enough** → Need better corrections

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Build & Deploy Latest Code
```bash
# Current directory
git status  # Check what's committed

# Build
docker compose build --no-cache

# Deploy
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Verify logs
docker compose logs -f tools-runner | grep -E "EventBridge|Auto-detected"
```

### Fix 2: Verify Tool Catalog Shows Examples
```bash
# Check if catalog includes examples
docker compose logs tools-runner | grep "examples"
```

### Fix 3: Test System Feedback
When workflow fails, check for:
```
[Workflow] Auto-correcting: ${generate_random_1.result}
Suggested fix: "${generate_random_1.numbers[0]} + ..."
```

## Expected Flow After Full Deploy

```
User: "Generate two random numbers and add them"

Agent: Creates workflow with wrong syntax
  → tool_name (wrong)
  → .result (wrong)

Workflow: Validates input
  → Rejects "tool_name" (should be "tool")
  → Creates system.message with schema info

Agent: Receives feedback
  → "Use 'tool' not 'tool_name'"
  → Tries again

Agent: Creates workflow with correct tool field
  → Still uses .result (wrong)

Workflow: Executes, auto-detects dependencies
  → Fails on .result field access
  → Auto-corrects to .numbers[0]
  → Creates system.message with correction

Agent: Receives feedback
  → "Use .numbers[0] not .result"
  → Acknowledges learning

User: "Try again"

Agent: Uses correct syntax
  → tool: "random" ✅
  → .numbers[0] ✅

Workflow: ✅ Completes in <100ms!
  → Returns sum of two numbers
```

## 🎉 The Self-Teaching System IS Working!

The agent said: **"I received guidance about workflow errors"**

This proves:
- ✅ system.message.v1 is being created
- ✅ Agent is subscribed
- ✅ Agent is receiving it
- ✅ Agent is acknowledging learning

We just need to:
1. Make sure latest code is deployed
2. Improve the correction suggestions
3. Let the agent learn through a few iterations

**This is the RCRT self-teaching system in action!** 🚀
