# Dashboard UX Improvements

## Problem Solved

The dashboard was resetting user filters and selections during automatic refreshes, creating a frustrating experience where:

- ❌ **Auto-refresh every 30 seconds** cleared all active filters
- ❌ **Manual refresh button** also cleared filters and selections
- ❌ **User state was lost** whenever the system updated
- ❌ **Disruptive experience** during active use

## 🎯 Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Smart Filter Preservation**
```javascript
// Before: Always cleared filters
filteredBreadcrumbs = [];

// After: Preserve active filters during refresh
const hadActiveFilters = filteredBreadcrumbs.length > 0;
if (hadActiveFilters) {
    applyFilters(); // Reapply to fresh data
} else {
    renderBreadcrumbs();
}
```

### 2. **Activity-Aware Auto-Refresh**
```javascript
// Before: Aggressive refresh every 30 seconds
setInterval(loadBreadcrumbs, 30000);

// After: Smart refresh only during inactivity
setInterval(() => {
    const timeSinceLastInteraction = Date.now() - lastUserInteraction;
    const inactiveThreshold = 60000; // 1 minute
    
    if (timeSinceLastInteraction > inactiveThreshold) {
        console.log('Auto-refreshing after user inactivity');
        loadBreadcrumbs();
    } else {
        console.log('Skipping auto-refresh - user is active');
    }
}, 120000); // Check every 2 minutes
```

### 3. **User Interaction Tracking**
```javascript
// Track user activity to prevent disruptive refreshes
let lastUserInteraction = Date.now();

// Update on key interactions:
- Mouse clicks and drags
- Filter applications  
- Breadcrumb selections
- Tag filter toggles
```

### 4. **Preserved Manual Refresh**
```javascript
// Before: Cleared everything
deselectBreadcrumb();
clearFilters();

// After: Preserve user state
// Preserve current user state (filters, selections) during manual refresh
// Only deselect if the selected item no longer exists after refresh
```

## ✅ Benefits Achieved

### **🎯 Better User Experience**
- ✅ **Filters Preserved**: User's filter settings survive auto-refresh
- ✅ **Selections Maintained**: Selected breadcrumbs stay selected
- ✅ **Non-Disruptive**: Auto-refresh only when user is inactive
- ✅ **Faster Response**: Less frequent automatic updates (2min vs 30sec)

### **⚡ Performance Benefits**  
- ✅ **Reduced API Calls**: 4x fewer automatic API requests
- ✅ **Smarter Timing**: Updates happen when convenient, not intrusive
- ✅ **SSE-First**: Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events, polling as backup

### **🎨 Workflow Preservation**
- ✅ **Active Work Protected**: Filtering/viewing work isn't interrupted
- ✅ **Custom Positions Preserved**: Node arrangements maintained
- ✅ **Context Maintained**: User doesn't lose place in their work

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Smart Refresh Logic**
1. **User Activity Detection**: Track mouse clicks, filter changes, selections
2. **Inactivity Threshold**: Wait 1 minute after last user action
3. **Backup Sync**: Auto-refresh only when user is away from interface
4. **State Preservation**: Reapply filters to fresh data instead of clearing

### **Real-Time via SSE**
The dashboard primarily uses **Server-Sent Events** for real-time updates:
- ✅ **Instant Updates**: New breadcrumbs appear immediately via SSE
- ✅ **Live Events**: See creation/updates in real-time event stream
- ✅ **Backup Polling**: Auto-refresh just ensures sync if SSE fails

## 🎉 Result

Users can now:
- **🔍 Keep Filters Active** while browsing and working
- **🎯 Maintain Context** during extended sessions  
- **⚡ Work Uninterrupted** by aggressive auto-refreshes
- **💪 Trust the Interface** to preserve their work state

The dashboard now provides a **professional, non-disruptive experience** while maintaining real-time data accuracy through SSE events.

**Test it**: Apply some filters, select a breadcrumb, then wait 2+ minutes. The auto-refresh should respect your active state and only update when you're not actively using the interface.
