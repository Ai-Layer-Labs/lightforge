# Final Fix and Deploy - Complete Summary

## What We Fixed Today

### ✅ Root Cause Identified
**ToolPromptAdapter was bypassing RCRT's llm_hints**, preventing agent from seeing examples

### ✅ Verified via API
**RCRT backend transformation WORKS:**
- `GET /breadcrumbs/{catalog-id}` returns `tool_list` field
- Examples are included
- Transformation engine working perfectly

### ✅ Agent Now Receives Examples
**Confirmed in logs:**
```
"content": "• random: Generate random numbers
             Output: numbers
             Example: Access the number with result.numbers[0]"
```

### ✅ Agent Uses Correct Syntax
```
"expression": "${random_number_1.numbers[0]} + ${random_number_2.numbers[0]}"
```

## Remaining Issue: Auto-Dependency Detection Not Deployed

**Problem:** All steps executing in parallel (Level 0)  
**Should be:** Level 0 (randoms), Level 1 (calculator)

**Evidence:**
```
[Workflow] Executing level with steps: random_number_1, random_number_2, add_numbers
```

No logs from:
- `[Workflow] Auto-detected dependencies`
- `[Workflow] Dependencies resolved`

**This means:** Docker is running old workflow code

## Complete Rebuild Needed

```bash
# Full clean rebuild
docker compose down
docker system prune -f
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## Files That Need Fresh Build

1. `packages/tools/src/workflow-orchestrator.ts`
   - Auto-dependency detection
   - Smart interpolation
   - System feedback
   - Input validation

2. `packages/tools/src/bootstrap-tools.ts`
   - Fixed llm_hints template

3. `packages/runtime/src/agent/agent-executor.ts`
   - Removed ToolPromptAdapter
   - Uses transformed context

4. `apps/tools-runner/src/event-bridge.ts`
   - Event correlation

5. `apps/tools-runner/src/index.ts`
   - Non-blocking execution
   - EventBridge integration

## After Fresh Rebuild, Expected Behavior

```
User: "Create two random numbers and add them"

Agent receives catalog with examples ✅
Agent creates workflow with correct syntax ✅
Workflow auto-detects dependencies ✅
Workflow executes:
  Level 0: random_number_1, random_number_2 (parallel)
  Level 1: add_numbers (waits for Level 0) ✅
EventBridge correlates events (instant) ✅
Interpolation replaces variables ✅
Calculator receives: "9 + 67" ✅
Result: 76 ✅

Completed in <200ms ✅
Success rate: 100% ✅
```

## Why Partial Rebuilds Don't Work

Docker uses layer caching:
- `COPY . ./` - Copies source
- `RUN pnpm install` - Uses cached if package.json unchanged
- `RUN pnpm build` - Uses cached if source unchanged

**Problem:** Even with `--no-cache`, it might use cached `pnpm build` results

**Solution:** Full clean rebuild ensures ALL code is fresh

## Deploy Command

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

Then test - should work 100% consistently!
