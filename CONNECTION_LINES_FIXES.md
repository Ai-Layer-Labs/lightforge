# Connection Lines Visual Fixes

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **2D Connection Line Styling**
**Before**: 
- ❌ Thick lines (3px)
- ❌ Too opaque (0.6 opacity)
- ❌ High z-index (15) - appeared in front of nodes
- ❌ Inconsistent with other connection lines

**After**:
- ✅ Thin lines (1px like other connections)
- ✅ Proper transparency (0.7 opacity)
- ✅ Low z-index (5) - appears behind nodes
- ✅ Consistent styling with other connection types

### 2. **3D Connection Support**
**Before**: 
- ❌ No secret connections in 3D view
- ❌ Missing 3D line rendering logic

**After**:
- ✅ Secret connections render in 3D view
- ✅ Red/orange 3D lines with proper transparency (0.25 opacity)
- ✅ Consistent with other 3D connection types

### 3. **Performance and Reliability**
**Before**: 
- ❌ Synchronous rendering causing potential hangs
- ❌ No error handling for connection failures

**After**:
- ✅ Async rendering with proper error handling
- ✅ Progressive loading for better performance
- ✅ Graceful degradation if connections fail

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements Applied**

### 2D View
```css
.connection-line.secret-connection {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.3), rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.3));
    height: 1px;           /* ← Thin like other lines */
    z-index: 5;           /* ← Behind nodes */
    opacity: 0.7;         /* ← Proper transparency */
}
```

### 3D View
```javascript
// Red/orange lines for secret connections - subtle like other connections
material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
    color: 0xff6b6b,      /* ← Red color for secrets */
    transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.25,        /* ← Subtle transparency */
    linewidth: 1          /* ← Thin lines */
});
```

## 🔗 **Connection Types Now Available**

| **Connection Type** | **2D Style** | **3D Style** | **Purpose** |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 📡 **Agent Subscriptions** | Orange gradient, 1px | Orange, 0.15 opacity | Agent → Subscribed breadcrumbs |
| 🛠️ **Tool Creation** | Green gradient, 2px | Green, 0.2 opacity | Tool → Created breadcrumbs |
| 🔐 **Secret Usage** | Red/orange gradient, 1px | Red, 0.25 opacity | Secret → Tool/Agent using it |

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

### 2D View (`http://127.0.0.1:8082`)
- ✅ **Thin red/orange lines** from OPENROUTER_API_KEY secret to OpenRouter tool
- ✅ **Lines appear behind nodes** (not blocking content)
- ✅ **Consistent styling** with other connection types
- ✅ **Hover effects** for better visibility

### 3D View (Click "🎲 3D View")
- ✅ **3D secret connections** visible between secret and tool nodes
- ✅ **Proper transparency** that doesn't obstruct view
- ✅ **Red color coding** to distinguish from other connection types
- ✅ **Semantic positioning** with proper clustering

## 🎯 **Test the Fixes**

1. **Refresh the dashboard**: `http://127.0.0.1:8082`
2. **Check 2D view**: Lines should be thinner and behind nodes
3. **Switch to 3D view**: Click "🎲 3D View" button
4. **Verify 3D connections**: Secret connections should appear in 3D space

The connection lines should now have proper styling and work in both 2D and 3D views! 🎉
