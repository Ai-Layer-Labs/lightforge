The Agentic Protocol Landscape
Understanding AG-UI, MCP, A2A, UI Specs, and How to Build Agentic Applications
Why Agentic Protocols Matter

How do these protocols work and help?

Interoperability → agents, apps, and tools speak a shared format

Transparency → open standards instead of proprietary SDKs

Reusability → modular, composable building blocks

Agentic Protocols

AG-UI • MCP • A2A

AI agents are becoming the place where user intent turns into action.
Agentic Protocols are the language of interoperability between models, tools, apps, and users.

Although protocols make agents compatible, the application layer makes them collaborative.

The Current Established Agentic Protocol Ecosystem

The ecosystem is organizing around a family of open, complementary protocols.
These are not competitors—they address different layers of agent behavior.

You can connect your application to agents directly via AG-UI, MCP, and A2A.

Adopted Standards
Protocol	Maintainer	Purpose
MCP (Model Context Protocol)	Anthropic / Open Source	Defines structured context & tool access between models and clients.
AG-UI (Agent–User Interaction)	CopilotKit / Open Source	Connects agentic backends and agentic frontends.
A2A (Agent-to-Agent)	Google / Open Source	Enables secure messaging & coordination between agents.
Handshakes Powering the Ecosystem
AG-UI ↔ MCP / A2A

AG-UI transforms low-level protocol interoperability into human-level collaboration.

Handshakes expose protocol activity to users:

AG-UI ↔ MCP → visualize tool outputs

AG-UI ↔ A2A → visualize multi-agent collaboration

Function:
A2A doesn’t let one agent use another agent’s MCP tools directly.
Instead, it enables negotiation, delegation, and coordination.

Outcome:
Agents coordinate and share intent and results—not tool access.

Parts of the Ecosystem
Type	Protocol	Purpose
Agent ↔ User Interaction	AG-UI	Event-based standard connecting agentic backends and frontends for real-time, multimodal interactions.
Agent ↔ Tools & Data	MCP	Allows agents to securely connect to external systems, data, workflows.
Agent ↔ Agent	A2A	Defines secure coordination and distributed collaboration.
Generative UI Specs
Type	Spec	Purpose
Declared UI	MCP UI (Anthropic), Open-JSON-UI (OpenAI)	Declarative, generative UI specifications letting agents define visual structure.
Unified Takeaway

AG-UI connects agentic apps ↔ backends

MCP connects agents ↔ tools/data

A2A connects agents ↔ agents

MCP-UI / Open-JSON-UI let agents return UIs

Agent–User Interaction Protocol (AG-UI)

AI agents have moved beyond chatbots into embedded product experiences.

What is AG-UI’s role?

Standardizing how humans and agents collaborate inside real applications.

AG-UI enables:

UI state updates

reactions to user actions

streaming outputs

real-time collaboration

Why AG-UI matters

It is the fastest-growing protocol in the agent–user domain.

AI-native UX evolution:
Agent as chatbot → Agent as co-worker inside my app

Supported Clients

React

Angular

Mobile

Slack

Email

Voice apps

SMS / WhatsApp

And more

AG-UI and Generative UI Specs

AG-UI is not a generative UI spec.
It is the bi-directional runtime connection between agentic backends & frontends.

It supports generative UI specs such as:

Spec	Origin	Purpose
Open-JSON-UI	OpenAI	Declarative generative UI schema
MCP-UI	Microsoft + Shopify	Open, iframe-based generative UI extension

AG-UI can interoperate with any generative UI standard.

Mixing and Matching

CopilotKit allows developers to connect to any protocol—AG-UI, MCP, A2A—individually or combined.

If a host agent connects to subagents via MCP or A2A, UI properties can propagate all the way to the application—while maintaining:

security

policy

observability

General-Purpose Bi-directional Connection

AG-UI serves as the “kitchen sink" protocol for building real agentic applications.

Common Misconceptions
Misconception:

AG-UI and MCP-UI compete.

Reality:
They solve different problems:

MCP-UI → defines what to render

AG-UI → defines how agents and users interact in real time

Misconception:

Protocols are competing for dominance.

Reality:
Protocols solve separate parts of the agent lifecycle. Interoperability is the goal.

Misconception:

Agentic protocols are just rebranded APIs.

Reality:
APIs connect products. Protocols connect ecosystems.

Misconception:

AG-UI is a visualization spec.

Reality:
It is an interaction protocol enabling stateful, multimodal agents.

Misconception:

CopilotKit replaces these protocols.

Reality:
CopilotKit sits above them as the agentic application framework.

Ecosystem Overview

CopilotKit sits above all protocols and generative UI specs as the unified agentic application framework.

With CopilotKit, developers can use any or all agentic protocols:

AG-UI

MCP

A2A

MCP-UI

Open-JSON-UI

CopilotKit + AG-UI

The future is multi-protocol composability.

Agents will speak multiple protocols simultaneously.

CopilotKit allows any user-facing app to connect to any agent across any protocol.

AG-UI remains the general-purpose, bi-directional connection between frontends and agentic backends.
