# Agent Runner Fix Summary

## Problem

The agent-runner was experiencing an infinite loop where the chat agent was triggering on its own responses, creating thousands of breadcrumbs and causing errors.

## Root Cause

The agent was receiving SSE events for breadcrumbs it created itself (like `agent.response.v1`, `agent.error.v1`, and `agent.metrics.v1`), causing it to process its own outputs as new inputs.

## Solution

We implemented a **creator-based filtering** mechanism in the `AgentExecutor`:

1. **Added creator metadata** to all breadcrumbs created by agents:
   ```typescript
   creator: {
     type: 'agent',
     agent_id: this.agentDef.context.agent_id
   }
   ```

2. **Implemented self-triggering prevention** in the `processEvent` method:
   - The agent fetches the triggering breadcrumb
   - Checks if it was created by itself
   - Skips processing if it's a self-created breadcrumb
   - Still includes self-created breadcrumbs in context for full conversation history

## Additional Fixes

1. **Fixed context fetching**: The `searchBreadcrumbs` API returns only summary data, so we now explicitly fetch full breadcrumb context for:
   - Agent definitions during registration
   - Tool catalogs when building context

2. **Fixed TypeScript compilation issues**:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Fixed property access for agent definitions
   - Resolved module resolution issues

3. **Docker build improvements**:
   - Added `.dockerignore` to prevent `node_modules` permission issues
   - Updated `setup.sh` for more robust builds
   - Added bootstrap integration

## Current Status

✅ **Infinite loop fixed**: Agent correctly skips self-created events
✅ **Agent loads successfully**: Default Chat Agent is registered and running
✅ **TypeScript builds cleanly**: All packages compile without errors
❌ **OpenRouter API key needed**: Agent returns 401 errors when trying to call LLM

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Set your OpenRouter API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
   ./set-openrouter-key.sh
   ```

2. **Test the chat agent**:
   ```bash
   node send-chat-message.js "Hello! Can you help me with something?"
   ```

3. **Monitor the agent's response**:
   ```bash
   docker logs breadcrums-agent-runner-1 -f
   ```

## Architecture Notes

The modern agent-runner now uses:
- **AgentExecutor pattern** for clean agent lifecycle management
- **Centralized SSE dispatcher** for efficient event handling
- **Creator-based filtering** to prevent self-triggering while maintaining full context
- **Dynamic tool discovery** via `tool.catalog.v1` breadcrumbs
- **Server-side transforms** via `llm_hints` for optimized LLM context
