# Resilient Startup System Improvements

## Problem Statement

The original system had issues with service startup order dependencies:
- Dashboard would fail to start if RCRT service wasn't ready
- JWT tokens would expire without renewal mechanism
- No retry logic for failed connections
- Services would fail permanently if started in wrong order

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Manager (`auth.rs`)

**Features:**
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Checks RCRT `/health` endpoint before attempting JWT requests
- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Implements retry logic with increasing delays (500ms → 1s → 2s → 4s → up to 30s)
- **Automatic JWT Renewal**: Background task that renews tokens before expiry (10 minutes before expiration)
- **Thread-Safe Token Management**: Uses `Arc<RwLock>` for concurrent access to token state

**Key Methods:**
- `check_service_health()`: Tests if RCRT is responding
- `get_valid_token()`: Returns current token or acquires new one if needed
- `acquire_token_with_retry()`: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- `start_token_renewal_task()`: Background task for automatic token renewal

### 2. Robust Request Handling (`handlers.rs` & `admin_handlers.rs`)

**Features:**
- **Dynamic Token Retrieval**: Each request gets fresh token if needed
- **Automatic Retry on 401**: If JWT expires mid-request, automatically retries with new token
- **Connection Recovery**: Handles temporary RCRT outages gracefully
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Maps different HTTP status codes to appropriate responses

**Helper Function:**
- `make_authenticated_request()`: Centralized request handling with retry logic

### 3. Service Startup Coordination (`main.rs`)

**Features:**
- **Health Check Wait**: Dashboard waits up to 5 minutes for RCRT to become healthy
- **Non-blocking Startup**: If RCRT isn't ready, dashboard still starts but retries in background
- **Background Token Management**: Token renewal task starts immediately on startup
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even if initial JWT acquisition fails

### 4. Docker Compose Improvements (`docker-compose.yml`)

**Changes:**
- Removed problematic health checks from distroless RCRT container
- Simplified service dependencies to avoid startup deadlocks
- Dashboard now relies on its own retry logic rather than Docker health checks

## Test Results

### Startup Resilience Test
```bash
# Test 1: Start dashboard before RCRT
docker-compose up -d db nats
docker-compose up dashboard  # Waits for RCRT
docker-compose up -d rcrt     # Dashboard connects automatically

# Results: ✅ Dashboard successfully waits and connects
```

### Connection Recovery Test
```bash
# Test 2: RCRT restart during operation
docker-compose stop rcrt      # Simulate RCRT outage
curl http://localhost:8082/api/breadcrumbs  # Fails gracefully
docker-compose up -d rcrt     # Restart RCRT
curl http://localhost:8082/api/breadcrumbs  # Automatically recovers
```

### JWT Renewal Test
- Background task runs every 5 minutes
- Renews tokens 10 minutes before expiry
- Handles renewal failures gracefully

## Key Benefits

1. **Order-Independent Startup**: Services can start in any order
2. **Automatic Recovery**: System recovers from temporary outages
3. **JWT Management**: Tokens are renewed automatically without manual intervention
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function during partial failures
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: All retry attempts and failures are logged for debugging

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `RCRT_URL`: RCRT service URL (default: http://localhost:8080)
- `OWNER_ID`: Owner UUID for JWT tokens
- `AGENT_ID`: Agent UUID for JWT tokens
- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (recommended: info)

### Timeouts and Retries
- Health check timeout: 5 seconds
- Max health check attempts: 10 with exponential backoff
- Startup wait time: Up to 5 minutes (30 attempts × 10 seconds)
- Token renewal interval: Every 5 minutes
- Token renewal threshold: 10 minutes before expiry

## Usage

1. **Normal Startup**: `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Test Resilience**: Use `./test_resilient_startup.sh`
3. **Monitor Logs**: `docker-compose logs dashboard -f`

## Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive logging:
- Service health check attempts
- JWT token acquisition/renewal
- Connection failures and recoveries
- Background task status

Example log output:
```
INFO rcrt_dashboard: Waiting for RCRT service to become healthy...
WARN rcrt_dashboard::auth: RCRT service health check failed (attempt 1/10), retrying in 500ms
INFO rcrt_dashboard::auth: Successfully acquired JWT token (attempt 3)
INFO rcrt_dashboard: Dashboard listening on 0.0.0.0:8082
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metrics**: Add Prometheus metrics for monitoring
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
3. **Health Endpoints**: Enhanced health checks with dependency status
4. **Configuration**: Make retry parameters configurable via environment variables
